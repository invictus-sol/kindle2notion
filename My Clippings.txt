Deep Work (Cal Newport)
- Your Highlight on Location 1091-1102 | Added on Saturday, January 12, 2019 11:08:17 PM

You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. Your will, in other words, is not a manifestation of your character that you can deploy without limit; it’s instead like a muscle that tires. This is why the subjects in the Hofmann and Baumeister study had such a hard time fighting desires—over time these distractions drained their finite pool of willpower until they could no longer resist. The same will happen to you, regardless of your intentions—unless, that is, you’re smart about your habits. This brings me to the motivating idea behind the strategies that follow: The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. If you suddenly decide, for example, in the middle of a distracted afternoon spent Web browsing, to switch your attention to a cognitively demanding task, you’ll draw heavily from your finite willpower to wrest your attention away from the online shininess. Such attempts will therefore frequently fail. On the other hand, if you deployed smart routines and rituals—perhaps a set time and quiet location used for your deep tasks each afternoon—you’d require much less willpower to start and keep going. In the long run, you’d therefore succeed with these deep efforts far more often.

You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life. (As argued in this rule’s introduction, attempting to schedule deep work in an ad hoc fashion is not an effective way to manage your limited willpower.)

the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical). The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.

the rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar. Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work. In much the same way that maintaining visual indicators of your work progress can reduce the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier.

the journalist philosophy. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession. This approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the opening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn’t come naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities—a conviction that what you’re doing is important and will succeed. This type of conviction is typically built on a foundation of existing professional accomplishment.

If we wish to escape addiction and avoid relapse, the most important factor is not what we are addicted to, but the state of our minds. We all have addictions, big or little. Many of these little addictions are more insidious than drug and alcohol addictions. We might, for example, be addicted to our own point of view, causing unnecessary harm through bigotry or hypocrisy. We might be addicted to feeling useless. We might be addicted to coming in first, or never trying because it is all too hard. We might be addicted to getting people to say nice things about us, or making them angry with us so we can blame them for our misery. These inner addictions are much harder to identify and change than the outer addictions, but they are more important. In the end, we are addicted to our own self-pity.

If we want to make an effort to change, we need to be motivated. At first the motivation to escape the addiction comes when our fear of the consequences is greater than our fear of being without our addiction. This is when we first say, ”Enough!” If we know that change is possible we find the energy to make those changes and actually put the ideas into practice. We do that by understanding that it is possible to change, by understanding what direction that change could take. That direction will follow the values we have chosen for our lives. It makes sense to choose values that are helpful. When we also hear about or meet people who have succeeded where we have not, then we are inspired to follow their path.

Knowing this also helps us to be motivated. As we do so, we reclaim responsibility for our ideas and motivations and actions.

Addictions are a desperate way of seeking happiness. They take us away from the uncomfortable or miserable or acutely painful reality of our lives. They provide a temporary relief. But like a fly trying to struggle out of a spider’s web, each time we seek that relief, instead of finding a way out of our dissatisfactions, we are caught more tightly.

For some people the “feeling good” aspect of addiction may be so strong that it is hard to resist. It is also hard for a diabetic to resist sugary foods. The diabetic and the addict both need to be determined to improve things, and that determination comes from the mind, from the way we think, not from the body. If we accept responsibility for the results of our choices, that in itself will strengthen our determination. If we also know that we can overcome the addiction, then we are inspired to change.

Fundamentally the problem is a mental problem. While it is true that external circumstances may make it easier or harder to gratify the addiction of our choice, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the originating cause of our addiction is in our mind. It is also true that if we do not accept responsibility for our addiction, and if we do not see a need to change, then nothing outside will help. The best cure for addiction is also within our own minds.

The mental addiction to feeling bad is similar. If we focus on how bad we are, then we can forget about other dif- ficulties. We do not have to do anything about them because we are so bad anyway. We give ourselves relief from a deeper pain. We can undermine the idea that short-term pleasure really gives us what we want by thinking about what makes us happy in the long term. This is part of what it means to develop wisdom.

Addiction Involves Compulsion: It Is a Habit When we constantly repeat something, it becomes a habit, something done without thinking. We lose the ability to choose because we have forgotten by this stage why we started the habit. We feel we are compelled to act. This feeling of compulsion may be so strong that we do not even know that we are caught in the addiction.

If we want to be free from addictions, then we also need to break the tightness of our self-centeredness. Unfortunately selfishness makes the addiction worse. Any time we feel bad, selfishness says thing like, “You have a right to be happy and this addiction will make you happy” or “I can’t cope. I need a break because it is all too much for me.” If we are to break that cycle, then we need to understand how faulty these justifications can be. It is the self-centered mind that catastrophizes and dramatizes the disasters that will happen if we do not have access to our addiction. Exposing these exaggerations is essential.

The point is, after hundreds of millions of years of cruel evolution, you, me, and most of our mammalian friends are left with brains that are really good at remembering smells, tastes, and sights. As Homo sapiens, we’re especially adapted to learning in ways that are vivid, visual, and experiential. Scientists refer to this as “the picture superiority effect.” And though many of you have been led to believe that you’re an “auditory” or “tactile” learner, the truth is, we are each naturally gifted at remembering pictures. What we’re not so naturally gifted at is learning from boring lectures or dense textbooks. Heck, we only invented writing systems some five thousand years ago, and the average person couldn’t read until a few hundred years ago. Evolution is an all-powerful mistress, but she’s not a fast-moving one.

FOUNDATION First and foremost, Knowles understood that as adult learners, we have a lot more life experience than children do. Not only do we have a larger body of knowledge to draw from; we’ve been around the block a few times, made our fair share of mistakes, and had our fair share of wins. For this reason, as adult learners, we come into the learning environment with some strongly held beliefs about the way things work. To the untrained learner, this prior experience and knowledge can be both an asset and a liability. On the one hand, it is easier for us to understand the world around us—and, as you’ll see later on, to create powerful connections

between our memories. On the other hand, holding on to our beliefs makes us less open to new information—even when it’s correct. What does this mean for us as adult learners? Put simply, it means that we should actively leverage our prior knowledge and experience when learning. We must compare and contrast the things that we’re learning to the information that we already know. How is it different? How is it the same? How can the information and experience we already have contribute to our understanding of this new and exciting topic? Far too often, we approach a “new” subject as if it’s completely foreign, when in fact, the whole of human knowledge is connected in some way. By making this powerful mindset shift alone, you will almost instantly become a more effective learner.

I used to think of my body as an instrument, of pleasure, or a means of transportation, or an implement for the accomplishment of my will. I could use it to run, push buttons, of one sort or another, make things happen. There were limits but my body was nevertheless lithe, single, solid, one with me.

Maybe none of this is about control. Maybe it isn’t really about who can own whom, who can do what to whom and get away with it, even as far as death. Maybe it isn’t about who can sit and who has to kneel or stand or lie down, legs spread open. Maybe it’s about who can do what to whom and be forgiven for it. Never tell me it amounts to the same thing.

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.

For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement. When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.

Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation.

Chapter Summary The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.

Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to do a hundred push-ups per day, that’s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated and excited, you can muster the strength to get started. But after a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur. Look at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you’ll see that it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on our phones, checking email, and watching television steal so much of our time because they can be performed almost without effort. They are remarkably convenient. In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.

Continually feeding our need for positive self-evaluation is a bit like stuffing ourselves with candy. We get a brief sugar high, then a crash. And right after the crash comes a pendulum swing to despair as we realize that—however much we’d like to—we can’t always blame our problems on someone else. We can’t always feel special and above average. The result is often devastating. We look in the mirror and don’t like what we see (both literally and figuratively), and the shame starts to set in. Most of us are incredibly hard on ourselves when we finally admit some flaw or shortcoming. “I’m not good enough. I’m worthless.” It’s not surprising that we hide the truth from ourselves when honesty is met with such harsh condemnation.

In areas where it is hard to fool ourselves—when comparing our weight to those of magazine models, for instance, or our bank accounts to those of the rich and successful—we cause ourselves incredible amounts of emotional pain. We lose faith in ourselves, start doubting our potential, and become hopeless. Of course, this sorry state just yields more self-condemnation for being such a do-nothing loser, and down, down we go. Even if we do manage to get our act together, the goalposts for what counts as “good enough” seem always to remain frustratingly out of reach. We must be smart and fit and fashionable and interesting and successful and sexy. Oh, and spiritual, too. And no matter how well we do, someone else always seems to be doing it better. The result of this line of thinking is sobering: millions of people need to take pharmaceuticals every day just to cope with daily life.

When Security Hub publishes a finding to EventBridge, it includes full details of the incident as discovered by GuardDuty. The finding is published in JSON format. If you review the details of the sample finding, note that it has several fields helping you identify the specific events that you’re looking for. Here are some of the relevant details: You can build an event pattern using these fields, which an EventBridge filtering rule can then use to identify events and to invoke the remediation Lambda function. Below is a snippet from the CloudFormation template we provided earlier that defines that event pattern for the EventBridge filtering rule: Once the rule is in place, EventBridge continuously scans the event bus for this pattern. When EventBridge finds a match, it invokes the remediating Lambda function and passes the full details of the event to the function. The Lambda function then parses the JSON fields in the event so that it can act as shown in this Python code snippet:

Chapter Summary The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time. Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior. HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT The 1st Law: Make It Obvious 1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them. 1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” 1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” 1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible. The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive 2.1: Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. 2.2: Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. 2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. The 3rd Law: Make It Easy 3.1: Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits. 3.2: Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier. 3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact. 3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less. 3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior. The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying HOW TO BREAK A BAD HABIT Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible 1.5: Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment. Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive 2.4: Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make It Difficult 3.6: Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits. 3.7: Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.

Chapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.

The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT]. After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip over. After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout journal. After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate. These tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you aren’t the type of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think you’ll find a few weeks of measurements to be insightful. It’s always interesting to see how you’ve actually been spending your time. That said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more important than any single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habits slide off track.

Chapter Summary One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.

Chapter Summary The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator. HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT The 1st Law: Make It Obvious 1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard.

Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation. The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.

As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you: What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do. What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree. Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor.

Chapter Summary The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.

The DDoS Mitigation System may be composed of a cluster of hardware and/or software resources, but could also involve an orchestrator that may take decisions such as outsourcing some or all of the mitigation to another DDoS Mitigation System. o DDoS Mitigation: The action performed by the DDoS Mitigation System. o DDoS Mitigation Service: designates a service provided to a customer to mitigate DDoS attacks. Each service subscription usually involve Service Level Agreement (SLA) that has to be met. It is the responsibility of the DDoS Service provider to instantiate the DDoS Mitigation System to meet these SLAs. o DDoS Mitigation Service Provider: designates the administrative entity providing the DDoS Mitigation Service. o Internet Transit Provider (ITP): designates the entity that delivers the traffic to a customer network.

- Your Highlight on Location 18-21 | Added on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 8:19:22 PM

To permit the transfer of routing information between neighboring ISPs, BGP requires Peering agreements, which comprise the necessary terms and conditions for exchanging traffic. The protocol adheres to these agreements, while also evaluating routing tables and information along multiple routes between ISPs. It does this using a selection algorithm that determines the best path to direct traffic based on specified commands and attributes. The best path might not always be the shortest path, however.

- Your Highlight on Location 28-30 | Added on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 8:19:30 PM

Because BGP takes these factors and more into consideration, it might direct traffic to take one path from the destination and another path on its return trip, resulting in asymmetric routing. This isn’t too problematic in terms of basic routing, but could cause complications in routes with firewalls and VPNs.

You have three choices when you stand in front of an on rushing force. You can push back directly against that force. You can step aside and let the force push past you. Or, you can redirect the force to a location that you choose. Now think of that “force” in the form of a Denial of Service (Attack). When DOS attacks are forces on the Internet which can be addressed with either of the three options. Of the three, redirection has been one of the mostly commonly used tools to “redirect” the DOS attack to a location which the Operator can better manage the attack. The foundation tool for that redirection is the used of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and the Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH).

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the glue which connect the Internet together. We use BGP as a tool to move and route GOOD traffic from one part of the Internet to the other. This also means we can use BGP to move BAD traffic to places that minimize the hard to the Internet – including places that “just drop” BAD traffic. We call this BGP security technique a Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH).
